Project Overview
This project is a containerized web application for "Tarot Cards by Lilu," a tarot card reading service. The website features information about tarot card readings, an about page showcasing Lilu's expertise, and contact information. The project demonstrates Docker containerization skills by implementing a multi-container setup with Node.js and Nginx.
Technologies Used

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend: Node.js, Express
Containerization: Docker, Docker Compose
Web Server: Nginx (as reverse proxy)

Docker Implementation
This project utilizes Docker to containerize the application, creating an isolated, reproducible environment that can run consistently across different platforms.
Container Architecture

Node.js Application Container: Serves the website and handles backend functionality
Nginx Container: Acts as a reverse proxy, handling HTTP requests and forwarding them to the Node.js application
