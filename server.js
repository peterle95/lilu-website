// In a real application, you would interact with a database to store user information securely.


/*Define a Passport Local Strategy for authenticating users. This involves comparing the provided email and 
password with the stored credentials in the database. 
You need to configure the strategy in your code.*/

passport.use(new LocalStrategy(

      // Compare provided credentials with stored user data
    }
  ));

  
  // Complete the User Registration and Login Logic:

  /* In the /register and /login routes, implement the logic for user registration and authentication. 
  For registration, you'll need to validate user input, 
  hash the password using bcryptjs, and store the user data securely.*/
  
  //For login, use Passport's authentication mechanism with the Local Strategy to check the user's credentials.
  
  // Session Management:
  
  /* Set up session management to track authenticated users across requests. 
  The express-session middleware handles this for you.*/
  
  // Testing:
  
  /* Test your registration and login routes thoroughly to ensure they work as expected. 
  You can use tools like Postman or curl to send HTTP requests.*/
  
  // Security:
  
  /* Ensure that you follow security best practices, such as securely storing passwords, validating user input, 
  and protecting against common web vulnerabilities like 
  CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) and XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)./*
  
  /* This is a basic outline of creating a Node.js backend for user registration and authentication. 
  In practice, you'll likely want to use a database to store user data securely and consider additional 
  features like email verification and password reset. Additionally, consider using a web framework like 
  Express to make the development process more structured and efficient.*/
